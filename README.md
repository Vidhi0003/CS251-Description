# Data Structures

This was a class I had taken in C++. I learned what data structures are and how data structures impacted the run time of code. This class allowed me to become a better programmer.

This class taught me how time complexity works in terms of my code and taught me what I can do to reduce the amount of time it takes for the code to run.
