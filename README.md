# Data Structures

This was a class I had taken in C++. I learned what data structures are and how data structures impacted the run time of code. This class allowed me to become a better programmer.

This class taught me how time complexity works in terms of my code and taught me what I can do to reduce the amount of time it takes for the code to run. Also, I was introduced to the topic of analyzing how much time it takes for code to run as well as what can I do to make code more efficient rather than simply writing code to pass the autograder.

Creating test cases was also something I learned as I had never created my own test cases. This allowed me to learn how to make my code more precise as I began to take into account edge cases. New skills like these helped me become a better programmer and understand some of the things happening behind the scenes.
